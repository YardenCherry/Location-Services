# War Game

## Introduction
This is a War Game application written in Swift. The game involves a player competing against the computer. The player's position (either east or west) is determined based on their geographical location relative to a specified midpoint latitude. The game features automatic card flipping with images of varying strengths, and scores are updated accordingly.

## Features

- **Geographical Positioning**: Determines playerâ€™s side (east or west) based on their location relative to the midpoint latitude: 34.817549168324334.
